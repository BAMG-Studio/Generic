# ForgeTrace Journey Archive

This folder captures the living history of ForgeTrace—from the earliest architectural discussions to the latest security mitigations. Each document digs into a different slice of the project so new contributors can ramp quickly while veterans retain institutional knowledge.

Update these narratives whenever we land a sizeable feature, learn something new, or retire a legacy path. Treat it like an engineering journal that should be just as actionable as the code.
