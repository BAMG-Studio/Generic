# Notes & Next Steps

What I created:
- `github-actions/` with 5 solution folders (2 DevOps, 3 DevSecOps)
- Per-solution README, example workflow YAMLs, and helper scripts

Next actions I can take on request:
- Convert example YAML files into `.github/workflows/*.yml` in this repo (your confirm)
- Flesh out Terraform scaffolds and run quick `terraform init` validations (requires AWS creds)
- Fix markdown lint warnings in `docs/scenario-5-security-workflows`
- Create a top-level summary S.T.A.R.T.Y set for scenario 5 for interview prep

Please specify which of the above I should proceed with next.
