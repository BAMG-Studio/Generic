## 🔊 CRITICAL: AUDIO INTEGRATION NEEDED

Your game is **silent** because audio files are placeholders. Here's what you need:

### Option 1: Quick Solution (Recommended)
**Use existing free sound libraries:**
1. Visit [Zapsplat.com](https://www.zapsplat.com) (free with attribution)
2. Download these sound categories:
   - UI sounds (button clicks, menu navigation)
   - Political events (applause, crowd reactions, gavels)
   - Crisis sounds (alarms, tension stings)
   - Success/failure sounds
3. Replace files in `client/public/sounds/`

**What you need:**
- Background music loop (replace `background.mp3`)
- Decision success sound (replace `success.mp3`)
- Additional effects as desired

### Option 2: AI Music Generation
**Mubert API** for custom AI music:
1. Get Mubert API key at [mubert.com](https://www.mubert.com)
2. Generate custom political satire themes
3. I can integrate it once you provide the API key

**Detailed Sound List:** See `ZAPSPLAT_DOWNLOAD_LIST.md` for complete inventory of needed sounds.
