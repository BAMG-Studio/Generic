## Lessons Learned

### What Went Exceptionally Well ✅

1. **Rapid Execution**: Moved from 75% to 100% in 2 days
2. **Beyond Expectations**: Created 3 additional strategic accounts
3. **Email Strategy**: Gmail plus-addressing working perfectly
4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides enabled quick corrections
5. **Best Practices**: Maintained architectural excellence throughout

### What Could Be Improved 🔄

1. **Initial Placement**: 30% of accounts initially placed incorrectly
   - **Root Cause**: Rapid creation without reference documentation
   - **Fix Applied**: Created action guide before corrections
   - **Prevention**: Use target structure diagram during account creation

2. **Verification Timing**: Issues caught after creation rather than during
   - **Root Cause**: No real-time verification step
   - **Fix Applied**: Final screenshot verification added
   - **Prevention**: Verify placement immediately after each creation

### Recommendations for Future Milestones 💡

1. **Pre-Planning**: Document complete target structure before execution
2. **Real-Time Verification**: Check placement after each account creation
3. **Reference Documentation**: Keep target diagram visible during work
4. **Incremental Approach**: Create → verify → next (not batch create → verify all)
