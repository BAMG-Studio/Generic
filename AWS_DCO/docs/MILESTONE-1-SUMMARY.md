## 🎯 Pre-Empted Steps & Context

### Steps Leading TO This Screenshot

**What happened before** (not shown, but documented):

1. **Account Setup** (not visible in screenshot)
   - AWS account created
   - Organizations service enabled
   - Root organization automatically created

2. **Console Navigation** (pre-screenshot)
   - Logged into AWS Console
   - Navigated to AWS Organizations service
   - Selected "AWS accounts" from left sidebar
   - Chose "Hierarchy" view (button visible in screenshot)

3. **OU Creation Process** (completed before screenshot)
   - Created DO-NOT-TOUCH OU
   - Created Non-production-OU
   - Created Production-OU
   - Created Sandbox-OU
   - Created Security-OU
   
**Evidence of completion**: All 5 OUs visible in the screenshot's hierarchy tree

### Steps Leading FROM This Screenshot

**What comes next** (documented in guides):

1. **Immediate Next: Verification** (Milestone 1 completion)
   - ✅ Verify all OUs appear correctly
   - ✅ Check each OU ID is unique
   - ✅ Confirm hierarchy structure is flat
   - ✅ Take screenshot (this screenshot!)
   - ✅ Document the structure (we've done this!)

2. **Short-term Next: Account Management** (Milestone 2)
   - Inventory existing AWS accounts
   - Determine which OU each account belongs in
   - Move accounts to appropriate OUs
   - Create new accounts as needed
   - Implement account naming conventions

3. **Medium-term Next: SCP Implementation** (Milestone 3)
   - Export baseline security SCP JSON
   - Create SCPs in Organizations console
   - Attach SCPs to OUs
   - Test SCP enforcement
   - Document SCP strategy

---

## 🔍 Deep Analysis: What the Screenshot Reveals

### Organizational Maturity Level
**Assessment**: Early stage (Milestone 1 complete)
- **Evidence**: OUs created but no accounts visible under them
- **Implication**: Structure is ready, population phase is next
- **Timeline**: Likely just completed OU creation, ready for account placement

### Design Philosophy
**Assessment**: Flat hierarchy, purpose-driven
- **Evidence**: All 5 OUs at same level under Root
- **Alternative not chosen**: Nested hierarchy (e.g., by region or business unit)
- **Rationale**: Simplicity, clarity, scalability to 100+ accounts

### Naming Strategy
**Assessment**: Self-documenting, clear purpose
- **Evidence**: 
  - "Production-OU" clearly indicates production workloads
  - "Non-production-OU" clearly indicates dev/test
  - "Security-OU" clearly indicates security tooling
  - "Sandbox-OU" clearly indicates experimentation
  - "DO-NOT-TOUCH" in all-caps signals critical infrastructure
- **Best Practice**: Naming tells you what the OU is for without needing documentation

### Future SCP Strategy (Predictable from Structure)
**Inference**: Different SCPs for different OUs
- **Production-OU**: Strictest SCPs (change management, encryption required)
- **Non-production-OU**: Moderate SCPs (baseline security, some flexibility)
- **Sandbox-OU**: Minimal SCPs (budget limits, learning freedom)
- **Security-OU**: Prevent security tool disablement
- **DO-NOT-TOUCH**: Most restrictive (emergency access only)

## 💡 What's NOT Visible (But Documented)

### Behind the Scenes
The screenshot doesn't show these technical details (but our docs do):

**Organization Details**:
- Organization feature set: All features (vs. consolidated billing only)
- Service control policies: Enabled but none attached yet
- Multi-account setup: Enabled and ready
- Trusted access: Services can be enabled for organization-wide use

**OU Properties**:
- Each OU can have:
  - SCPs attached (none yet)
  - Accounts as members (none yet)
  - Child OUs (none created - flat structure chosen)
  - Tags (not visible in this view)

**Next Actions Required**:
- Account creation/movement
- SCP creation and attachment
- Service enablement (GuardDuty, Security Hub, etc.)
- CloudTrail organization trail setup
