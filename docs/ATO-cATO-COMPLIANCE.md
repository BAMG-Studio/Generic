# 🏛️ ATO/cATO Compliance Framework

## Executive Summary

This DevSecOps pipeline implements **continuous Authority to Operate (cATO)** principles, providing automated evidence generation for NIST RMF compliance and reducing traditional ATO timelines from 12-18 months to 3-6 months.

## 🎯 What is EPSS and Why It Matters

### EPSS (Exploit Prediction Scoring System)
**EPSS** is a data-driven threat model that predicts the probability of a vulnerability being exploited in the wild within the next 30 days.

#### Key Differences from CVSS:
| Metric | CVSS | EPSS |
|--------|------|------|
| **Purpose** | Impact severity | Exploit probability |
| **Scale** | 0-10 (severity) | 0-1 (probability) |
| **Data Source** | Technical analysis | Real-world exploitation |
| **Update Frequency** | Static | Daily |

#### EPSS Risk Matrix Implementation:
```python
# Our risk prioritization logic
if epss_score >= 0.1:  # Top 10% exploit probability
    if cvss_score >= 7.0:
        priority = "P0-CRITICAL"  # 4-hour SLA
    elif cvss_score >= 4.0:
        priority = "P1-HIGH"     # 24-hour SLA
else:  # Lower exploit probability
    if cvss_score >= 9.0:
        priority = "P1-HIGH"     # Still urgent due to severity
    elif cvss_score >= 7.0:
        priority = "P2-MEDIUM"   # 72-hour SLA
```

#### Real-World Example:
- **CVE-2021-44228 (Log4Shell)**:
  - CVSS: 10.0 (Critical)
  - EPSS: 0.975 (97.5% exploit probability)
  - **Our Priority**: P0-CRITICAL (4-hour remediation)

- **CVE-2023-12345 (Hypothetical)**:
  - CVSS: 9.8 (Critical) 
  - EPSS: 0.001 (0.1% exploit probability)
  - **Our Priority**: P2-MEDIUM (72-hour remediation)

## 🏛️ ATO vs cATO: The Paradigm Shift

### Traditional ATO (Authority to Operate)

    A[System Development] --> B[Security Assessment]
    B --> C[Documentation Package]
    C --> D[AO Review]
    D --> E[ATO Decision]
    E --> F[3-Year Reauthorization]
```

**Timeline**: 12-18 months | **Cost**: $500K-2M | **Risk**: Point-in-time assessment

### Continuous ATO (cATO)

    B --> C[Real-time Evidence]
    C --> D[Continuous Monitoring]
    D --> E[Risk-Based Decisions]
    E --> A
```

**Timeline**: 3-6 months initial, then continuous | **Cost**: 60-80% reduction | **Risk**: Real-time visibility

## 🛡️ NIST RMF Control Implementation

### SI-2: Flaw Remediation

```yaml
# Automated remediation SLAs
Critical + High EPSS (>0.1): 4 hours
High + Medium EPSS: 24 hours  
Medium + Low EPSS: 72 hours
Low + Any EPSS: 7 days
```

**Evidence Generated**:
- `vulnerability-assessment.json` - Complete vulnerability inventory
- `epss-analysis.json` - Risk-prioritized remediation plan
- `remediation-timeline.json` - SLA compliance tracking

### SI-3: Malicious Code Protection
**Implementation**: Supply chain integrity with SBOM + attestations
```bash
# Every build generates:
syft dir:. -o spdx-json > sbom.spdx.json
cosign sign-blob --bundle sbom.bundle sbom.spdx.json
```

**Evidence Generated**:
- SPDX-compliant SBOM with cryptographic signatures
- Build provenance attestations (SLSA Level 2)
- Supply chain verification logs

### SI-4: Information System Monitoring  
**Implementation**: Continuous security monitoring
```yaml
# Real-time monitoring triggers
on: [push, pull_request, schedule]
# Automated alerting thresholds
Critical findings: Immediate Slack/PagerDuty
High findings: 1-hour notification
```

**Evidence Generated**:
- Real-time security scan results
- Automated incident response logs
- Continuous monitoring dashboards

### SI-7: Software, Firmware, and Information Integrity
**Implementation**: Cryptographic verification of all artifacts
```bash
# Integrity verification chain
git commit --gpg-sign
docker build --provenance=true
cosign sign $IMAGE_URI
```

**Evidence Generated**:
- GPG-signed commits
