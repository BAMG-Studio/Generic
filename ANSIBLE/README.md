# ANSIBLE DevSecOps Super-Folder

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview
Hybrid orchestration where Ansible serves as configuration management and infrastructure orchestration layer while GitHub Actions handles CI/CD execution.

## 🔄 Execution Model
1. **GitHub Actions triggers** → `ansible-playbook` commands
2. **Ansible orchestrates** → Infrastructure, security tools, compliance checks
3. **Results flow back** → GitHub Actions for reporting and next steps

## 🛡️ Key Features
- **ICS-Grade Security**: Network segmentation, endpoint hardening
- **SBOM Generation**: CycloneDX format with vulnerability correlation
- **Multi-Layer Security**: SAST, DAST, SCA, container scanning
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform + Terragrunt + CloudFormation
- **Zero-Trust Architecture**: OIDC authentication, least privilege access
- **Cost Optimization**: Infracost integration for cost monitoring

## 🚀 Lab Mode Capabilities
- Automatic error handling
- Ansible Vault for secrets management
- Demo testing with real-world scenarios
- Full lifecycle: Configuration → Development → Testing → Production → Monitoring → Incidents → Response → Postmortem
